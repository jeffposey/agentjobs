# AgentJobs Packaging & Integration Guide

Documented in historical context to capture the work completed during Phase 5.1.

This guide describes how AgentJobs was packaged for distribution, added to the
host automation project, and validated end-to-end. It provides the reference
material used during the integration milestone and serves as onboarding for
future deployments.

*Note:* The artifact is preserved for traceability; ongoing rollout steps should
be tracked via the current roadmap (see task-032 for v0.2.0 planning).
