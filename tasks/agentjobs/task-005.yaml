description: "## Proposal\nEnable CloudWatch Enhanced Monitoring for RDS instances\
  \ to get 1-second granularity metrics.\n\n## Cost\n- Current: $0/month (basic monitoring\
  \ only)\n- Proposed: ~$150/month ($2.50 per instance \xD7 60 instances)\n\n## Benefits\n\
  - 1-second metric granularity (vs 1-minute)\n- OS-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk\
  \ I/O)\n- Better troubleshooting during incidents\n- Proactive performance optimization\n\
  \n## Business Case\nLast month we had 3 database incidents that took >2 hours to\
  \ diagnose due to lack of granular metrics.\nExpected time savings: ~6 hours/month\
  \ \xD7 $200/hour = $1,200/month value.\n\nROI: 8x return on investment.\n\n**Awaiting\
  \ approval from Engineering Manager or CTO.**\n"
