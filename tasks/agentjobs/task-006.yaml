human_summary: Fixed memory leak caused by unclosed event listeners in WebSocket connections.
description: '## Problem

  WebSocket handler was leaking ~50MB/hour due to event listeners not being cleaned
  up on disconnect.


  ## Solution

  - Added cleanup handler for connection close events

  - Implemented WeakMap for connection tracking

  - Added memory usage monitoring


  ## Results

  - Memory usage stable at ~200MB (was growing to 2GB+ daily)

  - No more daily restarts required

  - Performance improved by 15%
