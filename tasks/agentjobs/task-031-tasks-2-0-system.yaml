human_summary: Legacy umbrella for Task 031 migration work. Superseded by phase-specific tasks (033-039).
description: |
  ## Objective

  Make AgentJobs self-hosted for its own development work by migrating Task 031
  out of the previous project and establishing the prompts and task records inside the
  agentjobs repository.

  ## Scope

  - Copy phase prompts into a dedicated `prompts/` directory
  - Convert Task 031 Markdown into a structured AgentJobs YAML task
  - Update phase tracking to reflect historical progress through Phase 5.2
  - Prepare AgentJobs for ongoing self-managed development with new tasks
  - Update cross-repo documentation to point at the new source of truth
  - Retroactively break down Task 031 into standalone phase tasks (task-033 through task-039)

  ## Status

  This record is retained for audit purposes but no longer receives direct
  updates. Active work now lives in the phase-specific tasks created during
  Phase 5.3.
