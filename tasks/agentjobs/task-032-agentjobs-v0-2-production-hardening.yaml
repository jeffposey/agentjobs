description: |
  ## Objective

  Harden AgentJobs for production deployments beyond the initial pilot environment by implementing
  authentication, deployment automation, observability, and GitHub integration.

  ## Scope

  1. **Authentication & Authorization**
     - API key authentication for REST endpoints
     - Role-based access (admin, agent, viewer)
     - Session management for the web GUI

  2. **Deployment Automation**
     - Docker container image
     - `docker-compose` for the full stack
     - Optional Kubernetes manifests for later scaling

  3. **Monitoring & Observability**
     - Prometheus metrics
     - Health check endpoints
     - Structured logging pipeline

  4. **GitHub Integration**
     - Sync tasks with GitHub Issues
     - Bi-directional updates
     - Webhook support for external triggers

  5. **Performance & Scaling**
     - Database connection pooling
     - Caching layer (Redis)
     - Load and stress testing harness

  ## Non-Goals

  - Multi-tenant support (future)
  - GUI task editing (Phase 6)
  - Mobile app experiences

    ## Objective

    Produce a production-ready release plan for AgentJobs v0.2.0 that covers
    authentication, deployment, observability, GitHub workflows, and scaling
    concerns. This iteration is design-heavy: assemble the technical architecture,
    service boundaries, deployment targets, and acceptance criteria that will let
    us split execution into focused follow-up tasks.

    ## Required Outputs

    1. Architecture brief covering:
       - Authentication / authorization model (API keys, session UX, RBAC matrix)
       - Secrets management and configuration strategy
       - Data storage impact (new tables, migrations, indexes)
    2. Deployment plan:
       - Container layout (Dockerfile responsibilities, multi-stage builds)
       - `docker-compose` topology with services, env vars, volumes
       - CI/CD path for publishing the image
    3. Operations design:
       - Monitoring metrics to emit and their collection endpoints
       - Health-check contract (liveness/readiness)
       - Logging format and shipping pipeline
    4. GitHub integration design:
       - Event flow for syncing tasks â†” issues
       - Webhook security story
       - Failure handling / retries
    5. Performance strategy:
       - Caching approach and invalidation rules
       - Load-testing scenarios + success thresholds

    Document the decisions in `docs/v0.2-production-hardening.md` with diagrams
    where helpful, and capture open questions for human review.

    ## Definition of Ready

    - Architecture brief reviewed and signed off by human stakeholders.
    - Stories broken down into executable sub-tasks with clear acceptance criteria.
    - Risks and mitigations called out explicitly.

    Once the document is ready, update this task with links to the artifact and
    transition it to `ready`.
