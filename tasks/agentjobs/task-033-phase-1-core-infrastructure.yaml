  Phase 1 established the foundations for AgentJobs as a standalone task
  management stack. The work produced the initial package layout, Typer CLI,
  Pydantic task models, YAML-backed persistence layer, and TaskManager with
  comprehensive unit tests. Documentation and packaging metadata were added to
  support local development and distribution.
