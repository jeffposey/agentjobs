description: |
  Phase 2 layered a FastAPI application on top of the core storage layer and
  delivered an httpx-powered TaskClient for agents. The work exposed REST
  endpoints for listing tasks, fetching prompts, updating status, and searching.
  Documentation and tests were expanded to cover the API workflows end to end.
