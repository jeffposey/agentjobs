description: |
  Phase 3 delivered a responsive, dark-mode web interface so humans (and agents)
  can inspect tasks visually. The release added Jinja templates for the dashboard,
  task list, and task detail pages, Alpine.js interactivity for filters, and the
  associated FastAPI web routes. The UI mirrors the Tradinator aesthetic while
  surfacing prompts, phases, and status updates clearly.
