  Phase 4.2 focused on user experience refinements that make AgentJobs
  comfortable for both humans and agents. The release introduced the
  `WAITING_FOR_HUMAN` status, added concise human summaries, surfaced waiting
  tasks prominently in the dashboard and navigation, and split task detail into
  Human vs Agent tabs. Sample data fixtures now cover all workflow states.
