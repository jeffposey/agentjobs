human_summary: Ship AgentJobs as an installable package, integrate it into the host project, and migrate the legacy tasks safely.
description: |
  Phase 5.1 prepares AgentJobs for everyday use by packaging the application,
  wiring it into the host automation project, and migrating the existing task
  catalog. The work verifies installation flows end-to-end, documents the
  integration process, and ensures the self-management loop is reliable before
  layering additional developer experience features.

  Key activities:
  - Build and publish the initial Python package (local install + version pinning)
  - Update host project dependencies and CI to install AgentJobs
  - Seed AgentJobs with migrated tasks from the prior system (34 total)
  - Verify CLI/GUI interactions against migrated data
  - Document integration steps for future rollouts
