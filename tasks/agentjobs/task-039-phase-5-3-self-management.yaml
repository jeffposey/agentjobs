human_summary: Move Task 031 and its prompts into AgentJobs so the platform manages its own development roadmap.
description: |
  Phase 5.3 made AgentJobs self-hosted for its own work. Task 031 and all phase
  prompts were migrated from Tradinator, task metadata was normalised into YAML,
  and Task 032 established forward-looking hardening work. The README now
  explains how AgentJobs uses itself, delivering meta-circular self-management.
