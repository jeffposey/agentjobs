  ## Objective

  Harden AgentJobs for production deployments beyond PrivateProject by implementing
  authentication, deployment automation, observability, and GitHub integration.

  ## Scope

  1. **Authentication & Authorization**
     - API key authentication for REST endpoints
     - Role-based access (admin, agent, viewer)
     - Session management for the web GUI

  2. **Deployment Automation**
     - Docker container image
     - `docker-compose` for the full stack
     - Optional Kubernetes manifests for later scaling

  3. **Monitoring & Observability**
     - Prometheus metrics
     - Health check endpoints
     - Structured logging pipeline

  4. **GitHub Integration**
     - Sync tasks with GitHub Issues
     - Bi-directional updates
     - Webhook support for external triggers

  5. **Performance & Scaling**
     - Database connection pooling
     - Caching layer (Redis)
     - Load and stress testing harness

  ## Non-Goals

  - Multi-tenant support (future)
  - GUI task editing (Phase 6)
  - Mobile app experiences
